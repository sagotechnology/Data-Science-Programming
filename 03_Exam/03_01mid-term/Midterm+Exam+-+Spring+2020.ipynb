The innate characteristics of statically typed languages make them run faster than dynamically typed languages. A statically typed language could allow for earlier detection of programming mistakes. Another caveat with dynamically typed languages is that variables don’t need to be declared as a data type; therefore, the end-user may have more difficulty trying to troubleshoot an error."

This characteristic also makes it easier to understand, which is an advantage because code is constantly revised--especially for data analysis.  Python’s clean and easy syntax allows for faster development and because it is a higher-level language it is dynamically typed.  Therefore, variables don’t need to be declared as a certain type and can hold different types of data at different times.  Also, the namespace capability of Python makes variable use more convenient for the developer.  Its automatically allocates memory and the user doesn’t need to know the memory address where something is stored.  The error checking is also easier to debug.  \n",
