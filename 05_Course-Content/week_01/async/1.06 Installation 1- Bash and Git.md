# Bash, Git, and GitHub setup instructions

In this class you will use **bash** (also known as terminal or shell) to submit certain commands using text via the "command line". You will also use **Git** to manage code versions and **GitHub** to share and access code online. This card details installation instructions.

As a MIDS student, 2U will send you an email to sign up for a 2U Github enterprise account. This account will work throughout W200 (and the rest of MIDS). 

* Windows users have a variety of command line type tools available. We recommend that you to use one of the bash flavor tools. To do this you can install "Git Bash" along with Git and GitHub via the installer below. 
* Linux and Mac OS users already have "bash" (called "terminal" on a Mac) installed by default. Mac users can access Terminal via their Spotlight search, and pin it to the dock for easy access.

**Optional** : You can sign up for a GitHub account on the [GitHub Homepage](https://github.com) by selecting "Sign Up". If you sign up with academic credentials, you can gain access to paid features by requesting a [free student account](https://education.github.com/) (**not required for this course and this can take a while to get approval**).


## Windows users: Installing Git and Linking to GitHub

The steps on a Windows machine are slightly more complicated because you will also need to install Git Bash, a terminal program that allows you to interact with GitHub from the command line.

1. Download the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Run the installer, and make sure to pick the option to install Git Bash in addition to the default options.  All other items can be left to their default setting.
3. On your computer, open the Git Bash application.
4. Follow instructions 3 and 4 from the "Mac/Linux users" installation instructions below.
5. if git bash does not install try this: (http://www.techoism.com/how-to-install-git-bash-on-windows/)

## Mac/Linux users: Installing Git and Linking to GitHub

The instructions below replicate those found online through [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

1. Download and install the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. On your computer, open the Terminal application.

3. Tell Git your name so your commits will be properly labeled. Type everything below: 

   ```git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"```

4. Tell Git the email address that will be associated with your Git commits. The email you specify should be the same one found in your GitHub email settings. To keep your email address hidden, see "[Keeping your email address private](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/)". Use the following command: 

   ```git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"```

You can now use Git and access GitHub via the Terminal. You will use this program whenever you need to enter command line commands in this course.
