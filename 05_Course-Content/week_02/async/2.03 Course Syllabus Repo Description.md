# Course Syllabus Repo Description
The Course-Syllabus repo can be found on Github here: https://github.prod.oc.2u.com/UCB-INFO-PYTHON/Course-Syllabus

This repo contains the information given during the async:

- Power point lecture slides
- Jupyter notebooks shown in lectures
- Drill notebooks for each week
- Drill solution notebooks
- Data files for the above notebooks (some of these data files are in the sub-folder named /data/)

### Drills

In each async unit, there are drills/exercise to help you practice the lesson and code more Python. These are optional and are not graded but are encouraged to bridge the gap between the lectures and the homeworks. Some notes on drills:

- Drills links in ISVC are run on a UC Berkeley Linux virtual machine. Drills will not save unless you download them.
- If you'd like to run the drill on your local machine or save your work please download the notebook. From the Jupyter notebook: go to the File menu then click 'Download As' -> Notebook (.ipynb) 
- You can also clone the Course-Syllabus repo (from the link above) and run the notebooks locally
- Drill solutions are provided in the Course-Syllabus repo in each week's folder (for example: /Course-Syllabus/week_02/week_02_drills_solutions/)
- If you have questions on the solution, please email the instructors or stop by an office hour
