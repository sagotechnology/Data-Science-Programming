    "Python’s programming language is easier to learn, compared to a compiled language, because it is more similar to human language.  This characteristic also makes it easier to understand, which is an advantage because code is constantly revised.  Python’s clean and easy syntax allows for faster development and because it is a higher-level language it is dynamically typed.  Therefore, variables don’t need to be declared as a certain type and can hold different types of data at different times.  Also, the namespace capability of Python makes variable use more convenient for the developer.  Its automatically allocates memory and the user doesn’t need to know the memory address where something is stored.  The error checking is also easier to debug.  Overall, if you are analyzing data as part of a larger system, Python makes the programming part much more user friendly.  Another advantage of Python is that it is cross compatible with different platforms and does not rely on certain system hardware. "
